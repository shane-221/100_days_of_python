# Dictionary Comprehension 2
# You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called weather_f that takes each temperature in
# degrees Celsius and converts it into degrees Fahrenheit.
#
# To convert temp_c into temp_f use this formula:
#
# (temp_c * 9/5) + 32 = temp_f

# Todo: Weather List
weather_c = {"Monday": 12, "Tuesday": 14, "Wednesday": 15, "Thursday": 14, "Friday": 21, "Saturday": 22, "Sunday": 24}

weather_f = {day: (temp_c*9/5)+ 32 for (day, temp_c) in weather_c.items()}

print(weather_f)
